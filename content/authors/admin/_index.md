I obtained my PhD in Crop Genetics and Breeding from the Huazhong Agricultural University in 2019, under the guidance of Prof. Jinxing Tu. My doctoral dissertation investigated rolling-cycle DNA transposon (Helitron) in Brassicaceae species and the gene evolution of Brassica napus. 

After joining the Zhang lab, I am interested in the evolution of cassette exons, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) associated with alternative splicing in brain development.
